hydroculture is the production of food without using soil and one of its most known activities is hydroponics aeroponics aquaponics etc,0,industrial development
let me explain some benefits,0,deforestation
one acre of hydroponics vegetables produces the same amount of food as 10 acres in agriculture,0,groundwater exploitation
growth cycle is faster for instance it takes for agriculture 90 days to harvest lettuce with hydroponics production takes less than 60 days,0,water withdrawals
since there is no need for using soil hydroculture can be performed anywhere that is within cities in desserts arid lands etc,0,pollution
no use of pesticides since production is controlled at least no herbicides,0,water withdrawals
